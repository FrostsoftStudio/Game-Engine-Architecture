# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

Why Ray tracing is not appropriate for real time rendering.

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> Really slow because of many rays needed for each pixel.

## Review

What is Global Lighting and how it is approximated in Phongs lighting model

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> Indirect light in the scene
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> Ambient coefficient which is added as constant

## Review

What is the difference between orthographics and perspective projection.

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> Orthographics preserve relative sizes and parallel lines

## Quick Recap

- Triangles
- Lighting
- Materials

## Rendering Pipeline

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Tools stage (offline). Geometry and surface properties (materials) are defined.
- Asset conditioning stage (offline). The geometry and material data are processed
by the asset conditioning pipeline (ACP) into an engine-ready
format.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Application stage (CPU). Potentially visible mesh instances are identified
and submitted to the graphics hardware along with their materials for
rendering.
- Geometry processing stage (GPU). Vertices are transformed and lit and projected
into homogeneous clip space. Triangles are processed by the optional
geometry shader and then clipped to the frustum.
- Rasterization stage (GPU). Triangles are converted into fragments that are
shaded, passed through various tests (z-test, alpha test, stencil test, etc.)
and finally blended into the frame buffer.
