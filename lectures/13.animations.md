## Review

What does this do?

```cpp
auto Location = GetActorLocation();
UE_VLOG_LOCATION(this, LogFPChar, Verbose, Location,
    10.f, FColor::Red, TEXT("Actor's firing location: %f, %f, %f"), Location.X, Location.Y, Location.Z);
```

## Review

Name me some console commands:

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `travel`
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `slomo`
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `pause`
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `quit`
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `stat unit`
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `shot`

## Animation algorithms

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Cel and sprite animations

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The oldest form of animation - draw the different frames and show them fast
enough, so that it appears smooth.

- *cel* is a transparent sheet on which images can be drawn
- different *cels* are applied over the static background to achieve the
  animated effect, without drawing everything from scratch

* Spritesheets are used for effects in UI
* Spritesheets can use huge amount of video memory, but they can be [compressed]

## Rigid body hierarchy

- model the character as a collection of rigid bodies

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- pelvis
  - torso
    - upper right arm
      - lower right arm
        - right arm
    - upper left arm
      - lower left arm
        - left arm
  - upper right leg
    - lower right leg
      - right foot
  - upper left leg
    - lower left leg
      - left foot

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Cracking at the joings
  - looks ugly
  - makes for unrealistic movements

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Morph targets

- Rigid body does not work well enough
- Animate each vertex instead
  - will create huge amounts of data

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- The artist creates the extreme positions of the vertices
- The extreme positions will be a smaller set
- The rest of the positions are computed as linear interpolation between two or
  more extemes

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Used primarly for facial animations
  - human face has 50 muscles
  - we are quite sensitive to facial expressions

## Skinned animations

- allows the triangles of the character to deform
- has the performance and memory requirements of the rigid body animation
- it is the most widely used today

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- The character has a skeleton of rigit bones connected with joints
- the skeleton is hidden behind the skin - a smooth and continous triangle mesh
  - (this avoids the joint cracking)
- AKA skeleton animation

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Bones

The term *bones* and *joints* are used interchangeably in computer games

- There are no bones actually in the skeleton
- All that matters is the positions of the joints

## Blending

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Blending poses requires matrix interpolation.

```
Matrix4x4 InterpolateMatrices(float alpha,
    const Matrix4x4& first, const Matrix4x4& second)
{
    return alpha * first + (1 - alpha) * second;
}
```
Easy, right?
