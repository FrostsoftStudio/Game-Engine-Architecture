## Memory leaks and corruption

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Leaks

Use a custom allocator for everything and dump leaks on exit.

```
#define MYNEW(System) new (System, __FILE__, __LINE__)

void* operator new(size_t size, Subsystem s, const char* file, int line) {
    return m_Allocs[s].Allocate(size, file, line);
}
```
--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Allocators

- tcmalloc
  - can create a detailed report of how much memory each function has allocated
- jemalloc
- heaplayers

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Tools

- Visual Studio
  - snapshot and snapshot comparison
- Valgrind
- Dr. Memory
- Heap Profiler

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Heap corruption

- reading un-initialized data
- reading or writing not-allocated memory

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Visual Studio in debug mode has checks for corruption
- Static analyzers can catch some of the errors
- Address Sanitizer
  - small performance impact
  - catches uninitialized read, use-after-free, out-of-bounds access, etc
- Valgrind - memcheck

## Logging and tracing

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Logging

- log functional aspects of the program
  - "Player John Doe has logged with avatar Johny"
- log to a console and to a file

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Tracing

- similar to logging
- shows what functions/code has been executed
  - "PlayerLogin()"

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Event tracing

Shows events in the program:

- allocations
- locks
- exceptions
- custom

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

- Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)
  - xperf
  - all the above combined with events from Windows
    - CPU usage
    - disk stall
    - ...
  - can be used for CPU, GPU and heap profiling

## Crash reporting

- collect everything possible and send it home
- google breakpad
- Mozilla's Socorro - https://github.com/mozilla/socorro
- Windows error reporting

https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/home/product/Firefox

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- OS has a callback that is called when the process is about to crash
  - collect data and save minidump
  - start another process to upload the data and the dump

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Minidump debugging

- Snapshot of the program state the moment it has crashed
  - Might be with heap, might be without heap

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Symbols - *pdb* files, *dsym*
  - minidumps are almost *useless* without symbols
- Source servers - automatically retrieve the version of the file that matches
  the one in the crashed game

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Telemetry

Send data and stats home while the game is running

- FPS
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
- (Gameplay events)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Heatmap everything

- find places with too many or too heavy objects
- (find places where the game is too hard)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Optimizations

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- do not optimize prematurely
- do not pessimize on purpose

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### How to optimize a game

- The hollistic approach

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Profilers

- Sampling
- instrumenting

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Profilers

- Visual Studio
- Valgrind - callgrind
- VerySleepy
- VTune
- gperf
- Remotery - https://github.com/Celtoys/Remotery
