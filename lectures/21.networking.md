## Networking

- latency - has a huge impact on the gameplay
- traffic - costs you money
- throughput

### Low level networking

The [BSD sockets API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) is used
almost on any platform
- some platforms have BSD sockets with some specifics


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- socket() creates a new socket of a certain socket type, identified by an
  integer number, and allocates system resources to it.
- close() causes the system to release resources allocated to a socket. In case
  of TCP, the connection is terminated.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- bind() is typically used on the server side, and associates a socket with a
  socket address structure, i.e. a specified local port number and IP address.
- listen() is used on the server side, and causes a bound TCP socket to enter
  listening state.
- accept() is used on the server side. It accepts a received incoming attempt to
  create a new TCP connection from the remote client, and creates a new socket
  associated with the socket address pair of this connection.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- connect() is used on the client side, and assigns a free local port number to
  a socket. In case of a TCP socket, it causes an attempt to establish a new TCP
  connection.


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- send() and recv(), or write() and read(), or sendto() and recvfrom(), are used
  for sending and receiving data to/from a remote socket.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() are used to resolve host names and
  addresses. IPv4 only.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- select() is used to pend, waiting for one or more of a provided list of
  sockets to be ready to read, ready to write, or that have errors.
- poll() is used to check on the state of a socket in a set of sockets. The set
  can be tested to see if any socket can be written to, read from or if an error
  occurred.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- getsockopt() is used to retrieve the current value of a particular socket
  option for the specified socket.
- setsockopt() is used to set a particular socket option for the specified
  socket.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Platform specific APIs provide more control and features.

## TCP vs UDP

- Transmission Control Protocol
  - reliable
  - in-order
- User Datagram Protocol
  - unreliable
  - out-of-order
  - may receive packets multiple times


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### TCP

- there is a connection
  - handshake
- checksums
- windows


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

![Connection](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/InternetSocketBasicDiagram_zhtw.png)


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- having an connection, means that the server needs a port for each client
  - 60K clients per server
  - IPv6 - Are we there yet?
- each packet is acknowledged
  - more traffic
  - lower thoughput

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- 32 bytes header for each packet
- The Maximum Transmission Unit for Ethernet is 1500B

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- A slower client can kill your server
  - no way to cancel a scheduled send
  - the networking buffers use memory too

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Pros:

- it just works

Cons:

- slow
- low efficiency in terms of traffic
- lack of control

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Pros:

- faster
- more efficient

Cons:

- no way to know what is going on
- have to keep the connection in the upper code

  - most platforms and engines have a built-in implementation

- Acknowledgment of received packets
- Windowing and flow control
- Retransmission of lost packets
- Over buffering (Faster than real-time streaming)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---
Pros:

- faster
- more efficent
- more control

Cons:

- requires some code

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### HTTP

- generally non-critical game code uses HTTP/TCP
  - TCP traffic can increase UDP loss rate

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Peer-to-peer networking

Providing better service for lower costs

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- great for voice streaming in game
- great for installs and updates
- "LAN" party

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### STUN

- because everybody has a router
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Tools

- https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet
- WireShark

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## High level networking


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Data Serialization

Reading and writing C++ objects through the network
 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCsEHYwjqVE

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Has to be automatically:

- it is error-prone
- it is boring 

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- reflection
- C++ meta programming
- protobuf, thrift, msgpack, flatbuffers

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Schema Upgrade

The ability to read older version of the data

- old clients talking to new server

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Remote Procedure Call

1. Each side has a `map<MessageId, Handler>`
2. Caller sends the message id and serialized arguments
3. Receivers deserializes the arguments, and calls the handler

- different versions of the protocol?

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Data Synchronization

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Referring to objects

- GUIDS - 16 Bytes might be too mach
  - memory
  - comparison!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Consequitive generated 8 byte numbers

- 2^64 / (1000 * 3600 * 24 * 365) ~= 584942417
- have a global source and give ranges of ids to each client


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Gameplay impact for networking

Gameplay
- strategy games
- sync random generators and the simulation, then send only player actions
- fps games - server travel back to time of the shot and does verification
- motion prediction
- sending only diffs and halfs
-
