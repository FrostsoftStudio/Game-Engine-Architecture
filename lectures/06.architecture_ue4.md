# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

Give example of 3 UFunction Specifiers?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> BlueprintCallable
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> Exec
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> Category

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

UE4 has 4 types of strings. What are they and what's their purpose?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `TCHAR*` - properly-encoded, null-terminated string
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> `FString` - a standard string class
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> `FText` - localized, immutable string, used for output
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> `FName` - interned, immutable string, used for identification

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What'a delegate?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> A wrapper around callable thing(s).

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UObject

The base class for everything

Provides:
* Garbage collection
* Reflection
    - neccessary for editor integration
    - neccessary for ref counting
* Serialization
* Some common methods

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UObject important functions

* T* NewObject( UObject* Outer, UClass* Class, ...) - Creates a new UObject
* bool IsValid(UObject*) - Returns true if the object is not null and not scheduled for delete
* UClass* StaticClass() - Returns a UClass object representing this class at runtime

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UClass

```cpp
UCLASS([specifier, specifier, ...], [meta(key=value, key=value, ...)])
class ClassName : public ParentName
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UClasses header

At the top of each gameplay class header file, the generated header file (created automatically) needs to be included

```cpp

#include "ClassName.generated.h"


```

UCLASS and GENERATED_BODY used by UHT for Reflection

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UClass Specifiers

* Abstract - Prevents the user from adding Actors of this class to Levels
* Blueprintable - Exposes this class as an acceptable base class for creating Blueprints
* Deprecated - This class is deprecated and Objects of this class will not be saved when serializing

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UStructs

* C++ structs with support for member (but not method) reflection
* More lightweight than UClass

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UStructs declaration

```cpp
USTRUCT([Specifier, Specifier, ...])
struct StructName
{
    GENERATED_USTRUCT_BODY()
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Struct Specifiers

* Atomic - always be serialized as a single unit
* BlueprintType - can be used for variables in Blueprints

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game object model

A game object model is the set of programming primitives
used to represent any object in the world.

Compare & contrast with what an object model.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE4 game object model

* UE4 is a mixture between OOP and component orientated design
  - Gameplay is component based, relying heavily on reflection
  - OOP is widely used for creating templates

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UE4 Gameplay subsystem

- Worlds, full of
  - Actors, full of
    - Components, Classes, Structs, full of
      - Properties and Functions

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE4 Worlds

Everything in the game is in a *world*.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

There are more than one world while you are using the game in the Editor. There
is a world for every editor window opened actually.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UE4 Actor and Component systems

* Everything that is in the world is an actor
* Each actor has different components
* Components can be
  - `Tick`-ed every frame (check `PrimaryComponentTick`)
  - Notified when certain events occurs on the owner object

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Actor

* Can be placed into a level
* Support 3D transformations
* Contains Root component
* Can contain other components as well

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Spawning

```cpp
AActor* UWorld::SpawnActor
(
    UClass*         Class,
    FName           InName,
    FVector const*  Location,
    FRotator const* Rotation,
    ...
)
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Lifecycle

* SpawnActor
* ...
* PostInitializeComponents - Called after the Actor's components have been initialized
* ...
* BeginPlay - Game stated

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Garbage Collection

* BeginDestroy - free up memory and handle other multithreaded resources
* ... 
* FinishDestroy - object is really going to be destroyed

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Unreal and Actors

* Unreal may create instances of your Actors whenever it likes!
* Never do anything in the constructor / destructor complicated of your actor
* Neither rely on that there will be only a single instance

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Components

* Special type of Object that Actors can attach to themselves as sub-objects
* Useful for sharing common behaviors

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Components

* UActorComponent - abstract behaviors and non-physical concepts
* USceneComponent - location-based behaviors
* UPrimitiveComponent - visual elements or to collide or overlap with physical objects

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Registering Components

```cpp

void UActorComponent::RegisterComponent()


```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game Mode

* Governs the rules of the game
* Only the server has an instance (for cheat prevention)
* Spawn gameplay relevant Actors there

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Game State

* Keeps the state of the game (Score, Teams, etc.)
* Every player has a copy
* You need to syncronize it in Multiplayer Games
