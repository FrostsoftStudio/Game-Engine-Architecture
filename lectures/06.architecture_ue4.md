# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

Give example of 3 UFunction Specifiers?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> BlueprintCallable
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> Exec
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> Category

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

UE4 has 4 types of strings. What's their purpose?


| Method     | Explanation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `TCHAR*` | Properly-encoded, null-terminated string <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FString` | A mutable, standard string class  <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FText`     | Localized, immutable string, used for output <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FName` | Interned, immutable string, used for identification <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What'a delegate?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> A wrapper around callable thing(s).

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UObject

The base class for everything, provides:

* Automatic memory management (via Garbage collection)
* Automatic editor integration (via reflection)
* Automically saving/loading
* Useful common methods

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UObject important functions

| Method     | Explanation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `T* NewObject( UObject* Outer, UClass* Class, ...)` | Creates a new `UObject` |
| `bool IsValid(UObject*)` | Whether the object can be used (not null and not scheduled for deletion) |
| `UClass* StaticClass()` | Localized, immutable string, used for output |

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UClass

```cpp
UCLASS([specifier, ...], [meta(key=value, ...)])
class ClassName : public ParentName
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UClasses header

At the top of each gameplay class header file, the generated header file (created automatically) needs to be included

```cpp
#include "ClassName.generated.h"
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UClass Specifiers

* `Abstract` - Prevents the user from adding Actors of this class to Levels
* `Blueprintable` - Exposes this class as an acceptable base class for creating Blueprints
* `Deprecated` - This class is deprecated and should not be used anymore

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UStructs

* C++ structs with support for member (but not method) reflection
* More lightweight than UClass

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UStructs declaration

```cpp
USTRUCT([Specifier, Specifier, ...])
struct StructName
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Struct Specifiers

* `Atomic` - always be serialized as a single unit
* `BlueprintType` - can be used for variables in Blueprints

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game object model

the set of programming primitives
used to represent any object in the world.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE4 game object model

* UE4 is a mixture between OOP and component orientated design
  - Gameplay is component-based
  - OOP is widely used for creating reusable templates

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
UCLASS(config=Game)
class AARCharacter : public ACharacter
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    /** Camera boom positioning the camera behind the character */
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    USpringArmComponent* CameraBoom;

    /** Follow camera */
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    UCameraComponent* FollowCamera;

    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    UAFAbilityComponent* Abilities;
}
```

## UE4 Gameplay subsystem

- Worlds, full of
  - Actors, full of
    - Components, Classes, Structs, full of
      - Properties and Functions

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE4 Worlds

Everything in the game is in a *world*.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Classes and structs can be created from inside the Editor.

### Live Demo Time

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

There are more than one world while you are using the game in the Editor. There
is a world for every editor window opened actually.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UE4 Actor and Component systems

* Everything that is in the world is an actor
* Each actor has different components
* Components can be
  - `Tick`-ed every frame (check `PrimaryComponentTick`)
  - Notified when certain events occurs on the owner object

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Actor

* Can be placed into a level
* Support 3D transformations
* Contains Root component
* Can contain other components as well

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Spawning

```cpp
AActor* UWorld::SpawnActor
(
    UClass*         Class,
    FName           InName,
    FVector const*  Location,
    FRotator const* Rotation,
    ...
)
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Lifecycle

* SpawnActor
* ...
* PostInitializeComponents - Called after the Actor's components have been initialized
* ...
* BeginPlay - Game stated

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Garbage Collection

* BeginDestroy - free up memory and handle other multithreaded resources
* ... 
* FinishDestroy - object is really going to be destroyed

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Unreal and Actors

* Unreal may create instances of your Actors whenever it likes!
* Never do anything in the constructor / destructor complicated of your actor
* Neither rely on that there will be only a single instance

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Components

* Special type of Object that Actors can attach to themselves as sub-objects
* Useful for sharing common behaviors

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Components

* UActorComponent - abstract behaviors and non-physical concepts
* USceneComponent - location-based behaviors
* UPrimitiveComponent - visual elements or to collide or overlap with physical objects

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Registering Components

```cpp

void UActorComponent::RegisterComponent()


```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game Mode

* Governs the rules of the game
* Only the server has an instance (for cheat prevention)
* Spawn gameplay relevant Actors there

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Game State

* Keeps the state of the game (Score, Teams, etc.)
* Every player has a copy
* You need to syncronize it in Multiplayer Games
