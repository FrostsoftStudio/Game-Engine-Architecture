# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What's PIMPL?

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> The pattern of publicly exposing only an interface,
implementing that interface in private code and exposing a `IFoo* CreateFoo()` function that creates the actual object.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

UE4 has 4 types of strings. What are they and what's their purpose?

* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> `TCHAR*` - properly-encoded, null-terminated string
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> `FString` - a standard string class
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> `FText` - localized, immutable string, used for output
* <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> `FName` - interned, immutable string, used for identification

## Review

What'a delegate?

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> A wrapper around callable thing(s).

## UObject

The base class for everything

Provides:
* Garbage collection
* Reflection
    - neccessary for editor integration
    - neccessary for ref counting
* Serialization
* Some common methods

## Game object model

A game object model is the set of programming primitives
used to represent any object in the world.

Compare & contrast with what an object model.

## UE4 game object model

* UE4 is a mixture between OOP and component orientated design
  - Gameplay is component based, relying heavily on reflection
  - OOP is widely used for creating templates

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UE4 Gameplay subsystem

- Worlds, full of
  - Actors, full of
    - Components, Classes, Structs, full of
      - Properties and Functions

## UE4 Worlds

Everything in the game is in a *world*.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

There are more than one world while you are using the game in the Editor. There
is a world for every editor window opened actually.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UE4 Actor and Component systems

* Everything that is in the world is an actor
* Each actor has different components
* Components can be
  - `Tick`-ed every frame (check `PrimaryComponentTick`)
  - Notified when certain events occurs on the owner object

- [Actor Lifetime](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/ActorLifecycle/index.html)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Unreal may create instances of your Actors whenever it likes!
- Never do anything in the constructor / destructor complicated of your actor
- Neither rely on that there will be only a single instance

## Game modes & state

* `AGameMode` governs the rules of the game
* `AGameState` governs replication of state across networking clients
