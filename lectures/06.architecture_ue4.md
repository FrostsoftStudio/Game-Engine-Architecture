## UE4 Architecture overview

* UE4 is a mixture between OOP and component orientated design
  - Gameplay is component based
  - The rest is OOP

--- NEXT SLIDE ---
## UE4 Gameplay subsystem

- Worlds, full of
- Actors, full of
- Components, Classes, Structs, full of 
- Properties and Functions

## UE4 Worlds

Everything in the game is in a *world*.

The UE4 Editor is a game, so?

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

There are more than one world while you are using the game in the Editor. There
is a world for every editor window opened actually.

## UE4 Actor and Component systems

* Everything that is in the world is a an actor
* Each actor has different components
    * each component has rendering and physics representation (or might not have
      any)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Unreal may create instances of your Actors whenever it likes!
- Never do anything in the constructor of your actor
- Neither rely on that there will be only a single instance

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- All gameplay objects in Unreal Engine 4 are garbage collected
- :/

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Never do anything in the destructor!
