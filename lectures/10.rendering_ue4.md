## Review

What's a mesh? 

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> A soup of triangles that describes a 3D model.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What's a texture?

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> Usually, a any image used during the game. Generally,
any array of data that the GPU uses.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What's a material?

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" --> An object that sets all possible rendering properties.
Ranging from diffuse color / normals to shaders

## Rendering in more detail

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Reminder from a time long past

Rendering is usually split in 3 levels:

* The graphics device
* Utilities for rendering common things - cubes, lines, models
* The scene graph

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

UE4 does mostly this:

* *RHI* (Rendering Hardware Interface)
* *RenderCore* - utilities (but not for drawing!)
* *Renderer* - does mostly everything else

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## The hardware device

Abstracts the GPU for you

* DirectX
* OpenGL
* Console-specific
* Console on nonconsoles - DX12, Vulcan, Metal

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## The shader model

The set of features supported by your GPU

* Shader model 5 supports GPGPU and tesselation
* Shader model 4 supports the unified shader model

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Working with a graphics-device overview

* Initializing the device
* Using the device to create helper objects
    - Render targets
    - Textures
    - Buffers
    - Samplers, Scissors, etc.
* Binding the state
* Drawing

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Initialize the device

```cpp
// Create the swap chain, Direct3D device, and Direct3D device context.
result = D3D11CreateDeviceAndSwapChain(
   NULL, D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_HARDWARE, NULL, 0, &featureLevel, 1, 
   D3D11_SDK_VERSION,
   &swapChainDesc, &m_SwapChain, &m_Devic, NULL, &m_Context);
if (FAILED(result))
{
    // Error
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Creating a resource

```cpp
D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC desc = { 0 };
desc.Width = 1920;
desc.Height = 1080;
desc.Format = DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM;
desc.Usage = D3D11_USAGE_DEFAULT;
desc.BindFlags = D3D11_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE;
D3D11_SUBRESOURCE_DATA* init = nullptr;

ID3D11Texture2D* resource;
HRESULT hr = m_Device->CreateTexture2D(&desc, init, &resource);
if (FAILED(hr))
{
    // Error
}
// Use the texture
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Binding state

```cpp
ID3D11ShaderResourceView* textures[MAX_TEXTURES_COUNT];
textures[0] = myTexture;
m_Context->PSSetShaderResources(0, 1, textures);

D3D11_RECT rect;
rect.top = 0;
rect.left = 0;
rect.right = m_CurrentRTDesc.Width;
rect.bottom = m_CurrentRTDesc.Height;
m_Context->RSSetScissorRects(1, &rect);

m_Context->VSSetShader(currentVS, nullptr, 0);
m_Context->PSSetShader(currentPS, nullptr, 0);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Drawing

```cpp
m_Context->IASetPrimitiveTopology(D3D_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLELIST);
m_Context->DrawIndexed(indexCount, startIndex, baseVertexIndex);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Shaders

* GPU programs written in a special language.
* DX uses HLSL, OpenGL uses GLSL
* HLSL is generally more widely accepted. And is also awesomer.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```hlsl
float4x4 WorldViewProjection;
struct VertexShaderInput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
};
float4 VertexShaderFunction(VertexShaderInput input) : POSITION0
{
    return mul(input.Position, WorldViewProjection);
}
float4 PixelShaderFunction(float4 position) : COLOR0
{
    return position; // Return the position as color
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### CPU <-> GPU communication

* Data is uploaded to the VRAM via the graphics device calls
* The CPU can access VRAM data but it's slow and requires a lock

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Different graphics devices have different APIs
(and capabilities).

Abstracting them is hard and should be minimal.

Enter RHI.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* RHI is the lowest-level rendering module.
* Provides abstractions over the GPU pipeline
* ...which in turn makes it a graphics device API
* `FDynamicRHI` is the interface for graphics devices
* `GDynamicRHI` is its intstance that drives everything

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* RHI simplifies the pipeline
    - The engine manages the graphics device
    - The engine hides shader compilation
    - Functions are generally higher-level than raw devices
* Helper objects are created with the global functions `RHICreateFoo`
    - The returned objects are instances of `FRHIFoo`
* State binding and drawing is done through `FRHICommandList`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## The command (task) pattern

* Create a functor that holds some state
* Store the functor in a queue of commands
* Execute when deemed neccessary
* Often used for multithreading; undo/redo systems

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The command pattern is used at multiple places
in UE4

`FRHICommandList` enqueues a command for the RHI threaded

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
// Object creation
FRHIResourceCreateInfo CreateInfo;
auto Texture = RHICreateTexture2D(SizeX, SizeY, uint8 Format,
    NumMips, NumSamples, Flags,
    FRHIResourceCreateInfo& CreateInfo);

auto BoundShaderState = RHICreateBoundShaderState(VertexDeclaration, VertexShader,
    nullptr, nullptr, PixelShader, nullptr);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
// State binding and drawing
CmdList->SetBoundShaderState(BoundShaderState);
PixelShader->SetShaderTexture(CmdList, TextureIndex, Texture);
CmdList->DrawIndexedPrimitive(
    IndexBufferRHI,
    EPrimitiveType::PT_TriangleList,
    BaseVertexIndex,
    FirstInstanceIndex,
    IndexCount * 3,
    StartIndex,
    PrimitiveCount,
    InstancesCount);
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Shaders

* Written in HLSL
* The Unreal Shader Compiler transpiles them for the target platform
* Stored in *Engine/Shaders/* in *\*.usf* files
* Need a CPP equivalent class

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
class FSusiPixelShader : public FGlobalShader
{
    DECLARE_SHADER_TYPE(FSusiPixelShader, Global);
};
..
IMPLEMENT_SHADER_TYPE(template <>, FSusiPixelShader, TEXT("SusiPS"), TEXT("SusiPS"), SF_Pixel);
..
auto GlobalMap = GetGlobalShaderMap(GMaxRHIShaderPlatform, false);
auto SusiShaderPS = *TShaderMapRef<FSusiPixelShader>(GlobalMap);
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## RenderCore

Provides several key utilities

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## The rendering thread

* UE4 uses separate rendering and RHI threads
    - the RHI thread executes graphics-device commands
    - the rendering thread enqueues commands for the RHI thread
    by setting up draw calls for meshes
* *RenderCore* manages both. See *RenderingThread.h*

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Enqueing tasks for the rendering thread

```cpp
FKitten* Kitty = SpawnANewKittyLionKingStyle();
ENQUEUE_UNIQUE_RENDER_COMMAND_ONEPARAMETER(RenderKitties,
    FKitten, Simba, Kitty,
    {
        Simba->Render();
    });
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### `FRenderCommandFence`

* Inserts a special-purpose command in the rendering queue
* Enables synchronization between the game and the rendering thread

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
class AMyActor : public AActor
{
    FRenderCommandFence Fence;
};
..
void AMyActor::BeginDestroy()
{
    // Request rendering resources destruction
    Fence.BeginFence();
}
bool AMyActor::IsReadyForFinishDestroy()
{
    return Fence.IsFenceComplete();
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Renderer architecture

* UE4 objects are not thread-safe!
* The rendering thread has its own set of classes:

| Game thread           | Rendering thread      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `UWorld`              | `FScene`              |
| `UPrimitiveComponent` | `FPrimitiveSceneInfo` |
| `ULightComponent`     | `FLightSceneInfo`     |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
/** FStaticMeshSceneProxy Actor is called on the game thread
    when a component is registered to the scene. */
FStaticMeshSceneProxy::FStaticMeshSceneProxy(UStaticMeshComponent* InComponent):
    Owner(InComponent->GetOwner()) <======== Note: AActor pointer is cached 
    ...

/** DrawDynamicElements is called on the rendering thread
    when the renderer is doing a pass over the scene. */
void FStaticMeshSceneProxy::DrawDynamicElements(...)
{
    if (Owner->AnyProperty) <========== Race condition!
        // The game thread owns all AActor / UObject state,
        // and may be writing to it at any time.  The UObject
        // may even have been garbage collected, causing a crash.
        // This could have been done safely by mirroring the
        // value of AnyProperty in this proxy.
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The rendering thread is always 1 or 2 frames behind.

Synchronization is done at the end of each `Tick()`.

## Deferred rendering

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Rendering paths

* Dynamic path
    - minimal insertion
    - high traversal cost
        - no state sorting
        - no state caching
* Static path
    - static draw lists
    - static sorting and caching
    - 3x faster
    - developer-friendly

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### The high-level path

1. `GSceneRenderTargets.Allocate`
1. `InitViews`
1. PrePass / Depth only pass
1. Base pass
1. Occlusion queries
1. Lighting
1. Fog
1. Translucency
1. Post Processing

Run `profilegpu` in the console for details
