# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

# What's this course about?

### The secret holy order of illuminati game developers

(just kidding)

(we'll have to kill you if we tell you about it)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Game development

* How does a game team look like?
* How does a commercially-succesful game engine look like?
* Is Unreal Engine 4 *awesome*? (hint: yes, yes it is)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Who should visit the course?

* Pokemons and power rangers.

In their absence, we'll have to fill in the gaps with:
* DEVELOPERS
* DEVELOPERS
* DEVELOPERS

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* We'll focus on programming
* We'll only spend some itty-bitty time discussing game design and content creation (they deserve a course of their own!)
* But you'll get to see how awesome UE4 is.
* We'll make it hard to you - homeworks, tests and a course project. Cheaters will be *bannished to the ethereal world.*

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Required knowledge

* OOP with C++
    - Next week we'll review and extend some C++ concepts
* Data structures
* First-year math - analytical geometry, basic calculus

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Why do we do it?

* We like torturing people
* We also *kind of* like speaking to other game developers
* We'd love to see more game developers

## Shameless advertisement time

* Coherent Labs makes UI middleware<sup>1</sup>
* We let people use HTML5 to build what's otherwise mundane, slow and error-prone
* We are platform-friendly - Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, WP8, iOS, Android, PS4, Xbox One
* We are engine-friendly - deep integrations into Unreal Engine 4 and Unity3D
* We are also building the first VR-first browser

<p class="left-aligned">
    <sup>1</sup> Awesome UI middleware

# Game development is

* ...damn fun
* ...incredibly rewarding
* ...an art form

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* ...incredibly time-consuming ![Prepare Your Posterior](resources/01.intro/prepare_thine_posterior.jpg)

# A game dev team

* Developers<sup>1</sup>
  - Game
  - Engine
  - Tools
* Designers (Game designers, level designers)
* Artists (Concept Artists, Modelers, Animators, Writers, Composers, Actors)

<sup>1</sup> Can be further specialized into subsystems.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# How is a game created?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Three phases:

* Pre-production
* Production
* Post-production

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Pre-production

* Idea for a game with a brief description
* Pitch - Why do we need to develop this game?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Concept
  - detailed description, budget, schedule, platforms, audience
  - concept art - mostly 2D art
  - prototypes of specific gameplay mechanics / game features

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Game design document
  - all of the above
  - updated during the production with more fine-grained details

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Prototype
  - proof of concept
  - vertical slice of the game, show the core (all) of the gameplay
  - answers whether the game will be fun
  - whether a technical challenge can be solved, i.e. 10000 avatars in a 1x1 km
    world

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Production

The actual development of the game. It is continous and iterative process.
* the game is constantly changing

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Game design

* Game designers / programmers create and program the gameplay
  - refine the gameplay
  - fill the game story

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Art Production

* models
* levels
* animations
* audio
* UI

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* 3D Models and levels start as 2D concept art
* After the concept art is "final"
  - modelers create 3D models
  - texturists create and apply textures to make the model visible
  - animators create the skeleton of the model and make it live
* Level designers use the models and create levels

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Developers
  - create features/systems to facilitate the gameplay
  - create tools to help designers be more productive
  - make sure that the game can simulate a whole city, draw every grain of sand
    on the beach, every drop of rain, while your ride on a race course

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The game is constantly played, tested, changed

  - no build = waste of time for the entire studio

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Milestones

- First playable
- Alpha
- Code freeze
- Beta
- Code release
- Gold master

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Post-production

- Maintenance
- DLCs
- Additional platforms

# What's a game?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Soft-realtime system

* it is important to draw at 60fps (90, 120 for VR)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Interactive

* respond to player input NOW!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Agent-based

* player vs the world

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Simulation

* photo-releastic graphics
* believable physics
* challenging AI

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# A game engine

* A game engine is a framework for creating games that provides
common reusable functionality
* Often genre-specific
* Writing a engine from a scratch is a huge effort - *don't* do it


--- NEXT SLIDE ---

# Game Engine requirements

* Vary between genres
  - compare open-world games vs fighting games

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

![WoW](resources/01.intro/wow_vs_tekken.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Performance
  - Frames per second >= 60 --> you only have 16 ms!
  - *Very easy* to mess up
  - *Very hard* to get right

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Graphics

![Graphics modes](resources/01.intro/graphics_modes.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Player input

![Input hardware](resources/01.intro/input.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Target hardware
    - Build once, run everywhere
    - Desktop platforms, consoles, mobile
    - STL?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Artists-and-designer-friendly
    - Non-programmers should also be able to use the engine
    - Designers need editors and scripting languages
    - Artists need a sensible asset pipeline

# Engine structure

[Click me](resources/01.intro/runtime_arch.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Hardware, OS, drivers and compilers
    - All platforms have an SDK of their own
    - Different compilers are needed (or better optimized) for specific platforms (i.e. MSVC is better than clang and gcc on Windows)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Third party middleware
    - Standard library
    - Low-level graphics API - DirectX, OpenGL, Metal, GLES
    - Physics simulation - Havok, PhysX, Bullet
    - UI - Coherent *, Scaleform, Iggy
