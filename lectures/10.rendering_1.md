# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Disclaimer

The following material should be covered by a complete course (at least one)
of its own.

## Ray tracing

![Ray tracing](resources/10.rendering/ray_trace_diagram.svg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Raytracing looks awesome! [Chaos Group](http://www.chaosgroup.com/en/2/index.html)
made a bussiness out of solving ray-tracing.

* [But it's reaaaaaaaaaaaly slow - 100+ rays for each pixel](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/12/pixar_quiz.html)
* So it mostly works on prerendered scenes (though it can be made to work for some cases)

Enter rasterization!

## Representations of objects

## Triangles

The triangle is the simplest type of polygon. Any fewer than three vertices,
and we wouldnâ€™t have a surface at all.

- A triangle is always planar.
- Triangles remain triangles under most kinds of transformations, including
  affine transforms and perspective projections.
- Virtually all commercial graphics-acceleration hardware is designed around
  triangle rasterization.

## Rendering Pipeline

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Tools stage (offline). Geometry and surface properties (materials) are defined.
- Asset conditioning stage (offline). The geometry and material data are processed
by the asset conditioning pipeline (ACP) into an engine-ready
format.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Application stage (CPU). Potentially visible mesh instances are identified
and submitted to the graphics hardware along with their materials for
rendering.
- Geometry processing stage (GPU). Vertices are transformed and lit and projected
into homogeneous clip space. Triangles are processed by the optional
geometry shader and then clipped to the frustum.
- Rasterization stage (GPU). Triangles are converted into fragments that are
shaded, passed through various tests (z-test, alpha test, stencil test, etc.)
and finally blended into the frame buffer.
