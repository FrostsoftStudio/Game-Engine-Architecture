## Unreal is huge!

* 5k directories
* 40k files
* Millions of code
* Hundreds of modules
* Who-knows-how-many tools
* Centuries of man-years

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Know thy tools

* VS Search-in-files (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>)
* VS Navigate-to (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>)
* [VS Chromium](http://chromium.github.io/vs-chromium/) (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>;</kbd>)
* Use Go-To-Source on your own risk (<kbd>F12</kbd>)
* VS Outlining

## Tips for starting


* Don't expect to learn everything! Even master Tim doesn't!

![Master Tim](resources/02.intro_ue4/tim_sweeny.jpg)

* UE4 is well-architectured. In time, you'll see that searching
for unknown features is pretty straightforward (unless you
are searching for core Editor features).

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Tips for starting

* There are many sample projects. Go play with them!
* There are many video tutorials. Go watch them!
* Experiment!

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

<!-- .slide: id="requirements" -->

## UE4 for our purposes

* We'll *only* run UE4 from source.
* We'll work in the latest stable version.
* Upgrading the engine whenever a new patch comes out is
your permament homework.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE4 for our purposes

UE4 requires some not-so-modest hardware.

* 8 GB of RAM
* a DX11 compatible video card
* Quad-core x86 CPU.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE4 for our purposes

As for software:

* We'll use VS2015 and Win10.
* You can also use any Windows above 7.
* Or Mac 10.9.2+ and XCode.
* If you want Linux, see [here](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Building_On_Linux).

<!-- .slide: id="setup" -->

## Setting up UE4

1. Create a github account if you don't already own one.
2. Go to [unrealengine.com](http://unrealengine.com)
and sign up.
3. Go to your profile and enter your github name.
4. Wait until you receive an email notifying you that you've
been added to the [EpicGames' organization in github.](https://github.com/EpicGames)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Setting up UE4

Open cmd and run:

```cmd
git clone git@github.com:EpicGames/UnrealEngine.git
cd UnrealEngine
git checkout <latest-stable-version>
setup.bat
GenerateProjects.bat
start UE4.sln
```
(replace `.bat` with `.sh` if you are running in bash/sh/zsh)


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

**IMPORTANT:** Clone UE4 near the root of your drive on Windows and
not 10 levels deep!

`setup.bat` takes a lot of time depending on your machine
and network connection but usually less than an hour.

Be patient and read some tutorials meanwhile.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Building

[Optional] Disable the unity build - open
*/Engine/Saved/UnrealBuildTool/BuildConfiguration.xml*
and copy this inside:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Configuration xmlns="https://www.unrealengine.com/BuildConfiguration">
    <BuildConfiguration>
      <bUseUnityBuild>false</bUseUnityBuild>
    </BuildConfiguration>
</Configuration>
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

1. Open VS / XCode. Select the *Developer Editor* configuration
and x64 platform.
1. Build the solution.
1. Go for a coffee with friends as you just made your computer unusable
for the next 1 to 4 hours while the engine is building.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Running the engine for the first time

* Start from VS as usual (F5 / Ctrl + F5)
* Create a new project.
* Choose your starter template, build and run it!

## Game structure

The engine, plugins and games share the same structure

| Directory | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| /Binaries | Executables & shared libraries                              |
| /Build    | Helper files for building the engine. Mostly batch files.   |
| /Config   | Configuration files.                                        |
| /Content  | Engine content. Files here are shared between all projects. |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

...

| Directory         | Description                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| /DerivedDataCache | Cached content data files (Engine only) |
| /Intermediate     | Temporary build products (Engine only)  |
| /Plugins          | Shared and project specific plug-ins    |
| /Saved            | Autosaves, logs, screenshots, etc.      |
| /Source           | Source code for all the things!         |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Game structure

Several files are essential for each game:

| File                                        | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *[GameName].uproject*                       | Stores general info - the engine version for the game, module structure. |
| *Source/[GameName].Target.cs*               | Used to setup the build environment for the *game*                       |
| *Source/[GameName]Editor.Target.cs*         | Used to setup the build environment for the *game* in the Editor         |
| *Source/[ModuleName]/[ModuleName].Build.cs* | Used to setup the build environment for each *module*                    |


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Plugins have the exact same structure - except their project
file is *[PluginName].uplugin* instead of *[GameName].uproject*.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

UE4 uses two main languages for programming

* C++ for all the core stuff
* Blueprints (BP) - a visual scripting language for designers and prototyping
* Blueprints are very helpful for rapid testing and prototyping
* C++ functions and classes can be exposed for usage in Blueprints

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Every Unreal project and the engine itself is separated into ***modules***.

* A module is a collection of code that implements some functionality.
UBT builds each module as a separate library.
* All C++ code must belong to a module.
* A game / plugin must contain at least one module.
* Creating a project also creates a module with the same name.
* Your C++ code goes to *Source/[ModuleName]*.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## A very quick demo

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## But where's all the code?

*Launch[YourPlatform].cpp* contains the engine's `main` (e.g. *LaunchWindows.cpp*)

If you were to remove all the details in it, you'll get something like this:

```cpp
int main()
{
    FEngineLoop GEngineLoop;
    GEngineLoop.Init();
    while (!GIsRequestingExit)
    {
        GEngineLoop.Tick();
    }
    GEngineLoop.Exit();
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

...

* *Never* create new C++ files from inside VS! Use the editor
or create them by hand. Remember to regenerate the projects.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### To git or not to git

When making your own projects, you only need the following files
and directories under source control:

* */Config*
* */Content*
* */Source*
* [GameName].uproject

It's dangerous to go alone! Take this
[*.gitignore*](https://gist.github.com/nikoladimitroff/c29f766a6a8ee59c3ba2).
