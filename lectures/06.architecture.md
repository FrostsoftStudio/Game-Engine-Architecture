## Review

- What does `TArray::Empty` do?

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game Loop

```cpp
bool gRUN = true;
int main()
{
    gRUN = Initialize();
    while (gRUN) {
        update();
    }
    Unitialize();
    return 0;
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Initialization

- Initialize the fundamental systems
  - memory management
  - logging and error handling
  - task systems
  - rendering - create the application / window and the graphics device

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

**Do not load levels, models, connect to servers, etc!**

This will make the start-up slow

Start the loop as fast as possible and show a loading screen.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Uninitialization

- flush and stop the fundamental systems

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Update

Do everything and do it in 16ms.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

```cpp
void update() {
    processInput();
    updateWorldState();
    updateRenderState();
    render();
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Frame

**Frame** is a single iteration of the `update` loop.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Process input

- local - keyboard, mouse, gamepads, steering wheel, HMD, kinect, etc
- remote
  - other players actions
  - server dictated state

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Update World State

- update actors' movement
- update actors' actions

So that the they correspond to the player's actions, but do not contradict the
laws in the game. (Players can not walk through walls)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Physics
- collisions and triggers
- Gameplay
- Update world simulation
  - NPCs

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Everything in a game is a continuous process. Otherwise it will last a single
frame and it won't have the chance to do anything.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Taking a shot in a shooter game.

- Player presses the trigger
- A particle system creates projectiles, smoke
- The player position, aim and game time are send to the server
- The server checks whether at the given game time, the player did hit something
- The server sends response with result, score, damage, etc.
- the game update scores, triggers particle systems for showing damage, etc

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Update Render State

- gather all objects visible to the Player
- determine what will be rendered and in what order
  - visible models
  - particles, decals
  - UI
  - visual effects

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Render

- record rendering commands
- replay the commands and draw everything

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Rendering command buffers

Why:

- Communication with the graphics device is not cheap
  - it involves calling driver / system functions (user mode vs kernel mode)
- Graphics drives can send more efficiently a batch of commands at once
- Great for multithreading

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Modern architectures

All modern game engines utilize multithreading in some form

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Basic

At least separate thread for rendering or every system in its own thread:

- Gameplay in main
- Rendering
- Physics
- IO

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

##### Synchronization

Although the systems run in different threads they are synchronized.

- Otherwise the player may see frame that has happened a couple of seconds ago
- Or the rendering thread may take all the resources and starve the other
  threads

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Side by Side

The renderer is rendering the same frame has just created

![render the same frame](resources/06.architecture/mt_render.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

###### Offset

The renderer is one frame behind the world

![render the previous frame](resources/06.architecture/mt_render_offset.jpg)


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Task based parallelism

- each actor or system update is a task
- allows better utilization of the system hardware

## Timing

Being on time is hard.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Time is important in order for the game to be immersive.

- It turns the discrete frames into smooth experience
- makes the game believable
- makes the game fair

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### How do we simulate a racing car going with 150 km/h?

- 150 km/h = 150 000 / 3600 ~ 42 m/s
- We *"make"* 60 frames per second, so we move it with 0.7 meters each frame
- ?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- What happens if the system can't make 60 fps and runs with 30?
  - the car will move with 75 km/h instead
  - players with slower machines will have advantage against the other
- what happens if the user has turned vsync off and the game runs with between
  30 and 120 fps?
  - the car reaches the trees near the sharp corner and automatically slows down

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Delta time

Time passed since the last frame.

This way time in the game doesn't depend on the framerate.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

So each frame we move the car with:

```
auto deltaTime = GetDeltaTimeInSeconds();
auto deltaCar = V * deltaTime;
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

How to get the delta time?

- We know it - it is 16ms!
  - No, it is wrong again
- Platform timers

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

#### Delta time aware loop

```cpp
using whatever::now;

auto lastFrameTime = now();
while (gRun) {
   auto currentFrameTime = now();
   auto delta = currentFrameTime - lastFrameTime;
   update(delta);
   lastFrameTime += delta;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

**?**

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The car will be moving at 42 m/s and will have moved 400 m after 10s.

**?**

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- usually time is measured in *ms* and stored in `float`
- accumulating lots of small float numbers create [accumulating error][error]
- the game time will move slower than the real one

[error]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/249467/what-is-a-simple-example-of-floating-point-rounding-error

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

```cpp
using whatever::now;

auto startTime = now();
while (gRun) {
   auto currentFrameTime = now();
   update(currentFrameTime);
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The moral so far:

- Use the time since arbitrary moment in the past.
- Never compute time by accumulating time deltas

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Use the time since arbitrary*?* moment in the past.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Unix timestamps are from January, 1st, 1970
- 1457888243 seconds since then.
- `float` has "precision" ~ 7 digits
- `float` can represent numbers up to 2^24
- 1457888243 / (2^24) ~ 87

**The timer gets precision of 128 seconds, i.e 2 minutes!**

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Timers and multithreading

- time can be different in different threads
- some OS may not support steady timers (historically)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The moral:

- Use the time since arbitrary moment in the past.
- Never compute time by accumulating time deltas
- Use types with sufficient precision for all time related computations

## Game objects

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

Traditional object-orientated programming doesn't work for games.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

If we are making *Super Mario*, then *Mario* has:

- input
- physics
- rendering

```
struct Player : Renderable, PhysicsObject, InputControlled
{
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Mario can get a kart to move faster

```
struct Player : Renderable, PhysicsObject, InputControlled, Motorized
{
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

NPC also have physics and rendering, but they are controlled by the AI

```
struct NPC : Renderable, PhysicsObject, AIControlled
{
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

You can not create a new object without a C++ engineer creating class for that.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

Using OOP will quickly lead to combinatorial explosion of classes.
It also:

- leads to tight coupling between the different subsystems
- "everything is slow" - OOP is not efficient

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Entity Component System (ECS)

Each entity (player, NPC, ...) is a collection of components (rendering,
  physics, input controlled, AI controlled)

- http://gamedevs.org/uploads/data-driven-game-object-system.pdf
- http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- We have: `RenderComponent`, `PhysicsComponent`, `InputComponent`, ...
- *Mario* is a collection of these components
  - When *Mario* gets the kart, it gets a `VehicleComponent`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Messages

- Most ECS allow gameobjects to have methods (messages)
- Each component can implement / subscribe for different messages
- Components can bid for methods and the highest bidder wins

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
auto mario = GetMario();
SendKey(mario, VK_SPACE);
```

- If Mario has a kart, both the `VehicalComponent` and `InputComponent` will
  receive the *SPACE* key

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
auto mario = GetMario();
auto speed = GetSpeed(mario);
```
- Both `CharacterComponent` and `VehicleComponent` implement the `GetSpeed`
  method
- `VehicleComponent` has higher bid, so if *Mario* has a kart, the speed of the
  kart will be reported

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

- Can represent any combination of characteristics
- Very easy to create a new combination - just add / remove component
- More efficient - each subsystem stores its own components and updates them
- It is easier to edit, modify and store objects
