# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What's a navmesh?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

Explain A* in navmeshes.

## Review

What's a decision (behaviour) tree?

## AI Controllers

* Reminder: Controllers tell pawns how to act
* The AI Controller controls AI-driven pawns
* We don't have to use them
but then again we don't have to use navmeshes either

## Pathfinding

* UE4 uses navmeshes...obviously
* Generated and explored by Recast & Detour
    - If you want to see the A* implementation, go check github
* Step 1: Add nav-mesh bounds!

## `UNavigationSystem`

* Let's you move actors
* Handles all of the Detour magic behind the scenes

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Reflex agents

* ...Cause we usually can't afford to use any other model

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Sensing

* `UPawnSenseComponent`
* See and hear others

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Thinking with behaviour trees

* Trees are event-driven
* Executed on demands instead of on each AI update
* Post tasks at queue
    - Remember the hierarchial task structure?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Thinking with behaviour trees

Control flow is managed by 3 node types

1. Selector
    - Succeeds if one child succeeds
1. Sequence
    - Succeeds if all child succeed
1. Simple parallel
    - Runs a task and a subtree in parallel
    - Succeeds if the main task succeeds

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Thinking with behaviour trees

* Decorators
    - Conditionals
* Tasks
    - Doers
* Services
    - Updaters
* Blackboard
    - Repository for data

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Environment queries

* Remember to enable EQS from the project settings!
* Generators
    - How to select results?
* Context
    - Where to start looking for results from?
* Filtering and scoring
    - Which results are the best?
* Testing pawns

## Crowd control

* Detour has you covered
* `ADetourCrowdAIController`

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Machine-learning applications / content generation

* Missing by default
* Infinite content-generation is scriptable though
* Idea for a startup
