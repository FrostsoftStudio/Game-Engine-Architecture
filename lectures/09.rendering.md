Triangles

The triangle is the simplest type of polygon. Any fewer than three vertices,
and we wouldnâ€™t have a surface at all.

- A triangle is always planar.
- Triangles remain triangles under most kinds of transformations, including
  affine transforms and perspective projections.
- Virtually all commercial graphics-acceleration hardware is designed around
  triangle rasterization.

Rendering Pipeline

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

- Tools stage (offline). Geometry and surface properties (materials) are de-
fined.
- Asset conditioning stage (offline). The geometry and material data are processed
by the asset conditioning pipeline (ACP) into an engine-ready
format.
- Application stage (CPU). Potentially visible mesh instances are identified
and submitted to the graphics hardware along with their materials for
rendering.
- Geometry processing stage (GPU). Vertices are transformed and lit and projected
into homogeneous clip space. Triangles are processed by the optional
geometry shader and then clipped to the frustum.
- Rasterization stage (GPU). Triangles are converted into fragments that are
shaded, passed through various tests (z-test, alpha test, stencil test, etc.)
and finally blended into the frame buffer.
