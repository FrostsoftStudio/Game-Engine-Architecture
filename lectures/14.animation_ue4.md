## Review

What's the difference between the rigid body hierarchy and
the skinned animation models?

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What's an animation pose and what's an animation clip?

## Review

What does IK stand for?

## Persona

* UE4 animation *editing* tool
* Provides a way for designers to specify animation blending,
action-state machines, IK, attach models
* Supports both skeletal and morph target animations
* Defines a ton of classes we're interested in

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### The artist pipeline for skeletal meshes

* Open Maya / 3DS Max / Blender
* Create the mesh*(es)* for the objects
* Create the skeleton
* Bind the skin to the skeleton
* Select a pivot point
* Export as *.fbx
* Import into UE4

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### The artist pipeline for animations

* Open Maya / 3DS Max / Blender
* Animate an existing skeleton
* Export as *.fbx either the entire character or just the animation
* Import into UE4

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### The artist pipeline for morph targets

* Open Maya / 3DS Max / Blender
* Create a mesh
* Duplicate & modify
* Export
* Import into UE4

## Persona's classes overview

They mostly map 1-to-1 with each of the exported objects.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Skeletal mesh

* Setting up materials
* Clothing
* LOD
* Maps to `USkeletalMesh`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Skeleton

* Separate from the skeletal meshes
* Managing sockets

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Sockets

Sockets provide means of attachment to the skeleton.

* Things can be attached to other things
    * statically
    * statically per-instance
    * dynamically

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Animation sequences

* A single animation clip
* Support events and animation curves
* Supports additive blending in joint and model spaces
* Can be further compressed

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Animation montages

* An animation made by reusing other animations
    * Start casting
    * Loop casting animation
    * End casting animation
* Breaks down to sections and slots

#### Animation composites

A simplified montage - can only append existing anims

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Blend spaces

* Can be used to do multidimensional blending
* Supports arbitrary number of samples

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Action-state machine

* A finite-state automaton
* Describes a set of rules that govern animation transitions
* Takes arbitrary input, outputs a pose

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Animation blueprints

* Special purpose blueprints
* Split into AnimGraph and EventGraph

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### AnimGraph

* Computes the final pose of the skeleton
* Can take as input animation samples, blend spaces or cached poses

#### EventGraph

* General-purpose blueprint
* Usually this part handles update logic whereas the AnimGraph uses
the results
* Handles the *BlueprintUpdateAnimation* event

We deliberately skipped over some parts!

## Implementation details

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* `USkeletalMesh` is the asset
    - Contains an instance of `USkeleton`
    - Bones are of type `FBoneData`
* `USkeletalMeshComponent` makes things have skeletons
* `ASkeletalMeshActor` is basically a ready-to-use actor with the `USkeletalMeshComponent`

## UE4's awesomeness

### Animation retargetting

* Allows the same skeleton to be used with multiple meshes
    * Required even when the mesh is the same, but slightly changed

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Skeletal controls

* A set of functions to modify joints directly
* Change joint transformation
* Sync joints (copy, drive)
* Spring controller
* IK

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* [Root motion](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Animation/RootMotion/index.html)
    - Enables animations to play well with collision
* Sync Groups
    - Used for synchronizing animations (that will be blended together)
    - Leaders and followers
* Physics-based animation for ragdolls, falls, hits
    - Set All Bodies Below Simulate Physics
    - Set All Bodies Below Physics Blend-Weight
